## Haja — ☁️ Cloud AI Infrastructure Engineer (Starting Jan 2026)

I build and operate AI systems that run in production: retrieval pipelines, evaluation + quality gates, and reliable cloud infrastructure for LLM-backed products. My work is backend-first, with a focus on measurable relevance, performance, and security.

🔎 **Focus:** AI platform infrastructure • Retrieval/RAG • Performance & security automation • Resilient deployments

## 🧭 What I work on
- 🧠 **AI retrieval infrastructure:** hybrid retrieval (graph + vector + structured filters), indexing, ranking, tuning
- ✅ **Production readiness:** load testing, latency/concurrency modeling, rollout safety checks
- 🔐 **Security automation:** OWASP ZAP scans wired into repeatable workflows
- 🛠️ **Cloud reliability:** active-active patterns, routing, TLS hardening, operational guardrails

## 🧰 Skills (backend-first, adaptable)
- 🧑‍💻 **Backend:** highly adaptable across backend stacks (APIs, services, data pipelines, integrations). This is my primary strength.
- 🎨 **Frontend:** not my focus (I can integrate and support, but I don’t position myself as a frontend specialist).

**Languages:** Python • TypeScript/JavaScript • Bash  
**AI/Retrieval:** LangChain • embeddings pipelines • hybrid ranking • evaluation workflows  
**Data/Stores:** Neo4j • PostgreSQL/pgVector • TiDB • MySQL  
**Infra/Delivery:** Docker • Nginx • Linux • active-active deployments  
**Testing/Quality:** k6 • Locust • Playwright • OWASP ZAP

## 🏛️ Production-grade deployments (publicly accessible)
Most of my production work serves **state government** use cases, so the **codebases are confidential**. Some deployed products are publicly viewable:

- 🌐 **Dayang chatbot (Sarawak services portal):** https://service.sarawak.gov.my/web/  
- ⚖️ **Court-related project (public article reference):** https://ekss-portal.kehakiman.gov.my/portals/web/home/article_view/0/5/1  
- 📚 **Malaysia public library chatbot (button-based):** https://www.u-library.gov.my/portal/web/guest

## 🚀 Selected public repositories (engineering examples)
These repos represent the kinds of systems I build (pipeline → retrieval → validation), even when production code is not public:

| Area | Repository | What it shows |
|---|---|---|
| 🎬 Local multi-agent AI app | **agentic-video-analyst** | offline inference + multi-agent orchestration + desktop app engineering |
| 🕸️ Graph ingestion + retrieval | **neo4j-document-pipeline** | graph modeling + retrieval API patterns for LLM workflows |
| 📈 Vector + hybrid experiments | **tidb-vector-llm-testbed** | relevance/scoring experiments, indexing tradeoffs |
| 🧬 Embedding pipeline | **mysql-to-pgvector-embeddings** | extraction → embeddings → pgVector semantic layer |
| 📚 Structured retrieval | **faq-retrieval-system** | structured query layer for grounded answers |
| 🧪 Performance testing | **playwright-dayang**, **k6-for-custom-dify** | UX + API load testing approaches for assistants |
| 🛡️ Security automation | **zap-security-api** | ZAP baseline/quick/full scan exposed via API |
| 🧩 Experiments | **playwright-study**, **besu-ibft2.0** | targeted learning repos (testing + distributed systems) |

## 🧠 How I approach AI systems
- 📏 Prefer **measured improvements** (evaluation + monitoring) over demo-only features  
- ⏱️ Treat **quality, latency, and security** as release criteria  
- 🔍 Build systems that are **operable** (clear failure modes, logs/metrics, runbooks)
