# 👋 Hi, I'm Haja

Product-focused Software Engineer & Technical Lead building end-to-end AI, data, and platform solutions — from ingestion pipelines and vectorized retrieval layers to performance, security, and deployment automation. I combine hands-on engineering with product ownership (chatbot platforms serving government users) to deliver reliable, scalable systems that solve real user problems.

## 🔎 What I Do
- **AI + Retrieval Engineering**: Build vectorization, knowledge graph, and hybrid search pipelines powering LLM workflows (Neo4j, TiDB vector search, pgVector).
- **Chatbot Product Ownership**: Lead development for production chatbot services serving Sarawak citizens and civil servants (multilingual context-aware Q&A).
- **Performance Engineering**: Design & execute load/performance tests using k6, Locust, Playwright (synthetic interaction + concurrency), plus custom harnesses.
- **Security Automation**: Provide on-demand OWASP ZAP scanning via API for CI/CD integration to enforce repeatable security posture.
- **DevOps & Infrastructure**: Deploy and operate active-active services on Alibaba Cloud ECS with engineered Nginx layer (failover, routing, SSL hardening); collaborate with data centre teams.
- **Data-to-LLM Enablement**: Convert relational (MySQL) + structured knowledge into embeddings + graph representations for semantic retrieval.
- **Quality & Reliability**: Integrate automated testing and benchmarking flows; design observability-minded ingestion & indexing services.

## 🛠 Behind-the-Scenes (Work Contributions)
Although not all source code is public, here are production-impact areas I lead or contribute to:
- Dayang Chatbot serving Sarawak users (public portal): Product ownership, performance tuning, retrieval logic refinement.
- Internal civil servant chatbot: Secure document-centric Q&A with domain filtering and authoritative source mapping.
- Performance test architecture: Locust & k6 distributed runs, workload modeling, concurrency threshold analysis.
- Active-active infrastructure: Alibaba Cloud ECS deployments, Nginx reverse proxy config (routing, SSL/TLS, rate handling).
- Cross-functional collaboration: Work with data centre teams for network, scaling, and operational readiness.

---
## 📊 Engineering Focus Areas
- Retrieval quality: Hybrid vector + structured filtering for higher precision.
- Observability mindset: Designing pipelines that surface latency and degradation signs early.
- Automation over repetition: Turning manual security/performance tasks into APIs & scripts.
- Product empathy: Translating user intent (citizen or civil servant) into robust conversational flows.

---
## 🧩 Differentiators
- Full spectrum: From raw data extraction → embedding/graph modeling → retrieval API → performance & security validation.
- Product + Engineering fusion: Ownership mindset (roadmaps, iteration loops) with hands-on implementation.
- Pragmatic experimentation: Use testbeds (like TiDB vector) to justify technology choices with measurable benchmarks.
- Security & reliability intertwined: Performance tests and ZAP scans baked into lifecycle—not afterthoughts.

## 📈 Sample Impact Metrics (Illustrative)
| Area | Example Outcome |
| ---- | --------------- |
| Retrieval Optimization | Cut irrelevant responses by >30% with graph + embeddings hybrid |
| Performance Testing | Defined concurrency thresholds; prevented overload events pre-launch |
| Security Automation | Reduced manual scan time from hours to minutes via API-triggered workflows |
| Infrastructure Resilience | Implemented active-active failover with minimal switchover downtime |
